Overview

According to the following steps:

1. Run script into workbench
2. Run query (select * from [table] where date between 2016 and 2019), export in csv file.
3. Import file in Python, execute the 1st requisition, group by zip code and aggregate by bottles_sold.
 In order to cross check the results , i create the same query in workbench. In Addition
 , for the 2nd requirement, i grouped by store_number and aggregate with bottles_sold. This is the moment when
 i'm having trouble understanding how to generate the output as a percentage.

 Overall, I faced these difficulties:
 - How to calculate the percentage.
 - How to make the plots, especially the second one.
 - How to publish my project to Workerly repository.
